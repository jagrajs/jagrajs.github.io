**Advanced Public Speaking Speech #3**

**Informative Speech Final Draft**

**Jagraj Singh, Winter 2017**


Back to the Future Part 2 promised us many things, from the unforgettable auto lacing Nikes to the iconic flying DeLorean. The shoes are arriving next season, but the flying cars are nowhere in sight. Technology has not caught up with Hollywood’s imagination. Even though we don’t have flying cars, cars as we know them today are changing. 

<br/> 

For over 100 years, cars ran on petrol and were run by humans. All that is changing. We are witnessing two major transitions in transportation technology. We are at the onset of both the electric and autonomous vehicle age. As a fan of cutting edge technology, I’ll be discussing the ways in which electric and autonomous cars will transform our way of life.

The first major transport transition is from fossil fuel powered vehicles to electric vehicles. Electric vehicles, or EVs, are cars that run purely on electricity. I’ll discuss EVs’ impact, price and batteries. 

<br/>

EVs are the disruptors in the fossil fuel vehicle industry and they bring with them great change. 
The greatest benefit of EVs is their environmental impact or their lack of an environmental impact. Now, I will not talk about climate change and all that because although we care about it, we don’t care to hear about it. I won’t go further than saying that EVs have zero emissions. Simple as that. 

In addition to the helping the environment, by driving an electric car you are essentially choosing not to support oppressive countries that provide the world oil. I won’t name any names, but you know exactly what countries I’m talking about. This may be many levels down the chain, but that is the case. 

<br/> 

Next, let’s take a look at the price.
As with all new technology, it is pricy at first, but eventually becomes cheap. We are seeing this with EVs. I’ll use Tesla Motors, the most famed and loved electric car company, as an example.

One of the first modern EVs, the Tesla Roadster cost over $100,000. Today, Tesla sells its Model S and Model X which start at 70 and $80,000 respectively. 

<br/> 

Mark your calendars for the end of this month, March 31, because that is when Tesla will officially announce its cheaper, mass production Model 3.

Other than the price of the car, the cost of maintenance is significantly lower. Compared to internal combustion engines, EVs have fewer moving parts which means fewer areas in which things can go wrong. No gas and no oil changes translates to huge savings.

Finally, we reach EV batteries.
Tesla is currently building its lithium ion battery factory called the Gigafactory. Once complete, the Gigafactory will mass produce Tesla batteries driving costs and prices down further. One thing it won’t eliminate is battery anxiety, or the fear of running out of battery charge while on the road. Currently, there are around 12,000 charging stations spread across the country - most of them free. For comparison, there are about 168,000 gas stations in the country. What’s interesting is that any house with electricity can become a charging station (so long as the driver doesn’t forget the car charger). There is no equivalent for gas stations.

Battery anxiety is offset by the “full tank of gas” feeling every morning reported by EV owners because their car, just like their phone, charged overnight.

<br/> 

Electric cars are transforming cars as we know them today. Autonomous cars will transform life as we know it. Autonomous cars or self-driving cars are cars that take you from point A to B without any human input other than destination. This may seem like a tremendous leap for vehicles, but history tells us that cars have been becoming more and more automated. From headlights to parallel parking all the way to automatic braking, cars have slowly been becoming more and more automated. It is only a matter of time until we hand computers the steering wheel.

The greatest benefit of autonomous cars will be their ability to transport people safely. Over 1.25 million people die in car crashes each year. Self-driving cars will decrease crashes by several orders of magnitude. Commuting will become safer. Google’s self driving car has proven this by logging almost 1.5 million miles in autonomous mode and getting into only one accident where it was at fault.

Other than safety, self-driving cars will be able to transport absolutely anyone. Driving licenses will become a thing of the past. It won’t matter if you are underage, overage, distracted, drunk, high, or even this guy. 

<br/> 

Self-driving cars will get you where you want to go. 

In addition to transporting pretty much anyone, self-driving cars will also be passenger-less! They will be able to perform the functions of taxis. When you arrive at the airport from a trip, you can summon your vehicle to pick you up and drop you off. Tesla’s autopilot update allows you to open and close your garage door parking and exiting the car saving you some time.

Instead of having a car per person like many families, sharing cars will be encouraged because they can drive other people while one person is at, say, work. Owning a car may become a thing of the past as those sharing cars could become a part of universal public transit. 

<br/> 

Electric cars are already here. Self-driving cars are right around the corner. In all probability, self-driving cars will be all electric, providing the best of both worlds. Both will transform our way of life. In the words of the man himself,

>“…humanity will advance with giant strides. The mere contemplation of these magnificent possibilities expands our minds, strengthens our hopes and fills our hearts with supreme delight…”

-Nikola Tesla

Thank you.
