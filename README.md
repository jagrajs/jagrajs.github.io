## About

This is my minimal portfolio website that has links to my social media, projects, résumé, and contact information.

## To Do

1. Move CSS to separate file while maintaining **exact** formatting (especially on mobile).

2. Remove 99% of unused CSS. See if there is a quicker way than manually going through 10,000+ lines.
